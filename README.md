Selleck
=======

Selleck is a tool for generating documentation from Mustache-based templates. It
was created to generate documentation for the YUI Library. It's still young and
evolving rapidly, but you may find it useful.

See <http://rgrove.github.com/selleck/> for detailed information and usage
instructions, as well as an example of the kinds of docs Selleck generates.

If you'd like to see more, [check out this sample][ac-docs] of the YUI 3
AutoComplete docs and examples, generated using Selleck.
